Notes
- Make a singly linked list. (Meaning each element in the list does not need to have information about any other element in the list except for the `next` element.)
- Each elemeent in the list contains data (a value) and a `next` field that points to the next element in the list of elements
- The elements of our linked list may contain any data values
-We'll need a method that reverses a linked list as well as the method that convert a linked list to and from an an array
- We may need to also write several helper methods.
